## How may I use the API?

### DO

We encourage you to build applications that **extend** Dribbble to platforms beyond the web and offer services that Dribbble does not.

### DON'T

Please don't build what we're building. We've invested a lot of time, money and hard work in Dribbble. Our team and many of our members rely on Dribbble for income. As such, we ask that you do not build an application, website, product, or business that attempts to harm, compete with, or replace Dribbble, our website, or our services.

In particular, do not use the API, or any Dribbble data, to build the following:

- A website that replicates or replaces the essential user experience of dribbble.com
- A website that attempts to replace dribbble.com as a destination for Dribbble content
- A community or social network for designers
- A search service for finding designers or designers for hire
- Tools for hiring designers or contacting designers for hire
- A job advertising or job search service

We'll do our best to communicate fair use of the Dribbble API in this space and others, but the onus is on you to contact us and inquire whether your use of the API is permitted.

## Members and Content

Dribbble members own all rights to their content and it is your responsibility to make sure your use of the API does not contravene those rights. You are solely responsible for making use of Dribbble images and other member data in compliance with members' requirements and/or restrictions.

You must remove from your application, within 24 hours, any Dribbble shot or personal information that the owner, or Dribbble, asks you to remove.

## Commercial Use

You are free to use the Dribbble API for commercial use, provided that you abide by these terms and do not build an application or business that attempts to harm, compete with or replace Dribbble, our website, or our services.

## Mobile Applications

Dribbble does not have an official iOS or Android app, nor are we currently building one. It's worth noting that we don't aspire to make push advertising our primary business model and thus do not feel compelled to control the non-web experience for this reason. It's possible that we may discover another reason to warrant an official app; for example, if we deem the user experience on non-web platforms unsatisfactory. But we've taken time to identify and develop our business model and now have terms in place to protect it. With those protections, we are excited to expose the API toward fostering a software ecosystem around Dribbble that encourages developer participation and innovation, particularly in the mobile application space.

## Portfolios

Many designers use their Dribbble profile as a portfolio of sorts. Additionally, we plan to offer a portfolio service called Playbook in the near future. Having said that, our members own their own content, and if they wish to display it using a website or service that uses the API, that is their right. However, such a website or service may not offer any of the restricted features above, such as social networking and search for designers or designers for hire, or it will be considered a competing offering and be disallowed.

## API Only

The only Dribbble data you may use in your product or application is that which is exposed via our API. Please don't scrape our site or copy our data. If you can't access something via the API, it's because we don't want you to.

## Be Gentle

Don't overburden our servers. We've published some specifics with regard to <a href="/v1/#rate-limiting">rate limiting</a>, but we reserve the right to determine abuse or excessive usage of the API and throttle or block any service accordingly.

## Termination

Dribbble can refuse API access at any time for any reason. This is not a card we hope to play often, but it's impossible to anticipate every situation. We reserve the right to decline any request for API usage and block access to the API.

## Liability

Dribbble is not liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential or exemplary damages arising from your use of the API. These include, but are not limited to, damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data or other intangible losses, resulting from your API usage or third-party products that access data via the API.

Your use of the Dribbble API is at your own discretion and risk, and you will be solely responsible for any damage that results its use, including, but not limited to, any damage to computer systems or loss of data incurred by you, your users, or your customers.

## Terms Can Change

Dribbble reserves the right to update and change these terms at any time without notice.
