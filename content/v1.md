# Overview

This describes the resources that make up the official Dribbble API. If you have
any problems or requests please [contact support][].

{:toc}

## Schema

All API access is over HTTPS, and accessed from the `api.dribbble.com/v1/`
endpoint. All data is sent and received as JSON.

<pre class="terminal">
$ curl -i https://api.dribbble.com/v1/users/simplebits

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Thu, 13 Feb 2014 19:30:30 GMT
ETag: "def2bc69c674e5b48cd281aa12c2c8e9"
Server: nginx
Status: 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
Cache-Control: max-age=0, private, must-revalidate
X-RateLimit-Limit: 60
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 59
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1392321600
</pre>

Blank fields are included as `null` instead of being omitted.

All timestamps are returned in ISO 8601 format:

    YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ

## Parameters

Many API methods take optional parameters. For GET requests, any parameters not
specified as a segment in the path can be passed as an HTTP query string
parameter:

<pre class="terminal">
$ curl -i "https://api.dribbble.com/v1/users/simplebits/followers?page=2"
</pre>

In this example, the "simplebits" value is provided for the `user` parameter in
the path while `page` is passed in the query string.

For POST, PATCH, PUT, and DELETE requests, parameters not included in the URL
should be encoded as JSON with a Content-Type of
"application/x-www-form-urlencoded".

## HTTP Verbs

Where possible, the API strives to use appropriate HTTP verbs for each action.

Verb | Description
-----|-----------
`GET` | Used for retrieving resources. |
`POST` | Used for creating resources. |
`PUT` | Used for updating resources with partial JSON data, or performing custom actions. |
`DELETE` | Used for deleting resources. |

## Authentication

There are two ways to authenticate through Dribbble API.

### OAuth2 Token (sent in a header)

<pre class="terminal">
$ curl -H "Authorization: Bearer OAUTH_TOKEN" https://api.dribbble.com/v1/user
</pre>

### OAuth2 Token (sent as a parameter)

<pre class="terminal">
$ curl https://api.dribbble.com/v1/user?access_token=OAUTH_TOKEN
</pre>

## Pagination

Requests that return multiple items will be paginated to 30 items by default.
You can specify further pages with the `page` parameter. For some resources, you
can also set a custom page size up to 100 with the `per_page` parameter. Note
that for technical reasons not all endpoints respect the `per_page` parameter.

<pre class="terminal">
$ curl https://api.dribbble.com/user/followers?page=2&per_page=100
</pre>

Note that omitting the `page` parameter will return the first page.

### Link Header

The pagination info is included in [the Link
header](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988). It is important to follow these
Link header values instead of constructing your own URLs.

    Link: <https://api.dribbble.com/user/followers?page=2&per_page=100>; rel="next",
      <https://api.dribbble.com/user/followers?page=50&per_page=100>; rel="last"

The possible `rel` values are:

Name | Description
-----------|-----------|
`next`  | Shows the URL of the immediate next page of results.
`prev`  | Shows the URL of the immediate previous page of results.
`first` | Shows the URL of the first page of results.
`last`  | Shows the URL of the last page of results. <span class="note">Not provided by all endpoints.</span>

## Rate Limiting

For requests using OAuth, you can make up to 3,600 requests per hour. For
unauthenticated requests, the rate limit allows you to make up to 60 requests
per hour.

You can check the returned HTTP headers of any API request to see your current
rate limit status:

<pre class="terminal">
$ curl -i https://api.dribbble.com/users/simplebits

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Status: 200 OK
X-RateLimit-Limit: 60
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 59
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1392321600
</pre>

The headers tell you everything you need to know about your current rate limit
status:

Header Name | Description
-----------|-----------|
`X-RateLimit-Limit` | The maximum number of requests that the consumer is permitted to make per hour.
`X-RateLimit-Remaining` | The number of requests remaining in the current rate limit window.
`X-RateLimit-Reset` | The time at which the current rate limit window resets in [UTC epoch seconds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time).

If you need the time in a different format, any modern programming language can
get the job done. For example, if you open up the console on your web browser,
you can easily get the reset time as a JavaScript Date object.

<pre><code class="language-javascript">new Date(1392321600 * 1000)
// => Thu Feb 13 2014 14:00:00 GMT-0600 (CST)
</code></pre>

Once you go over the rate limit you will receive an error response:

<pre class="terminal">
HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
Status: 403 Forbidden
X-RateLimit-Limit: 60
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 0
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1392321600

{ "message" : "API rate limit exceeded." }
</pre>

You can also [check your rate limit status](/v1/rate_limit) without incurring an
API hit.

### Staying within the rate limit

If you are using OAuth, and you are exceeding your rate limit, you can likely
fix the issue by caching API responses and using [conditional
requests](#conditional-requests).

If you're using conditional requests and still exceeding your rate limit, please
[contact us][contact support] to request a higher rate limit for your OAuth
application.

## User Agent Required

All API requests MUST include a valid `User-Agent` header. Requests with no
`User-Agent` header will be rejected. We request that you use your Dribbble
username, or the name of your application, for the `User-Agent` header value.
This allows us to contact you if there are problems.

Here's an example:

<pre class="terminal">
User-Agent: Live-Rebounds
</pre>

If you provide an invalid `User-Agent` header, you will receive a `403
Forbidden` response:

<pre class="terminal">
$ curl -iH 'User-Agent: ' https://api.dribbble.com/v1/rate_limit

HTTP/1.0 403 Forbidden

{
  "message" : "Missing required User-Agent header."
}
</pre>

## Conditional requests

Most responses return an `ETag` header. Many responses also return a
`Last-Modified` header. You can use the values of these headers to make
subsequent requests to those resources using the `If-None-Match` and
`If-Modified-Since` headers, respectively. If the resource has not changed, the
server will return a `304 Not Modified`. And making a conditional request and
receiving a 304 response does not count against your [Rate
Limit](#rate-limiting), so we encourage you to use it whenever possible.

## Cross Origin Resource Sharing

The API supports Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) for AJAX requests. You can
read the [CORS W3C working draft](http://www.w3.org/TR/cors), or [this
intro](http://code.google.com/p/html5security/wiki/CrossOriginRequestSecurity)
from the HTML 5 Security Guide.

Here's a sample request sent from a browser hitting
`http://example.com`:

    $ curl -i https://api.dribbble.com/v1/users/simplebits -H "Origin: http://example.com"
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://example.com
    Access-Control-Expose-Headers: ETag, Link, X-RateLimit-Limit, X-RateLimit-Remaining, X-RateLimit-Reset
    Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true

This is what the CORS preflight request looks like:

    $ curl -i https://api.dribbble.com/v1/users/simplebits -H "Origin: http://example.com" -X OPTIONS -H "Access-Control-Request-Method: GET"
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://example.com
    Access-Control-Allow-Methods: OPTIONS, GET
    Access-Control-Expose-Headers: ETag, Link, X-RateLimit-Limit, X-RateLimit-Remaining, X-RateLimit-Reset
    Access-Control-Max-Age: 86400
    Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true

## JSON-P Callbacks

You can send a `callback` parameter to any GET call to have the results wrapped
in a JSON function. This is typically used when browsers want to embed content
in web pages by getting around cross domain issues. The response includes the
same data output as the regular API, plus the relevant HTTP Header information.

<pre class="terminal">
$ curl https://api.dribbble.com?callback=bar

bar({
  "meta" : {
    "status" : 200,
    "X-RateLimit-Limit" : 60,
    "X-RateLimit-Remaining" : 59,
    "X-RateLimit-Reset" : 1392321600,
    "Link" : [
      ["https://api.dribbble.com?page=2", { "rel" : "next" }]
    ]
  },
  "data" : {
    // ...
  }
})
</pre>

You can write a JavaScript handler to process the callback like this:

<pre><code class="language-javascript">function bar(response) {
  var meta = response.meta
  var data = response.data

  console.log(meta)
  console.log(data)
}</code></pre>

All of the headers are the same String value as the HTTP Headers with one
notable exception: Link. Link headers are pre-parsed for you and come through as
an array of `[url, options]` tuples.

A link that looks like this:

    Link: <url1>; rel="next", <url2>; rel="foo"; bar="baz"

... will look like this in the callback output:

<%= json "Link" => [
  ["url1", { rel: "next"}],
  ["url2", { rel: "foo", bar: "baz"}]] %>
